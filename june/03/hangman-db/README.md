This folder structure should be suitable for starting a project that uses a database:

* Clone the repo
* `rake generate:migration <Name>` to create a migration
* `rake db:migrate` to run it
* Create models
* ... ?
* Profit

You may need to fiddle around with remotes assuming that you don't want to push to this one (which you probably don't).
