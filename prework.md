# Ruby Prework
### DC Q1 2015

_James Dabbs (james@theironyard.com)_

We've got [a lot](https://dgosxlrnzhofi.cloudfront.net/custom_page_images/64/page_images/Rails_Competencies.png?1386276348) to cover and only a few short weeks to do so. I'm going to ask that you complete some preliminary work, so that we can establish a common starting point and spend class time focusing on things that are most difficult to learn on your own.

These assignments won't make you a Ruby master (if they could, I wouldn't be here) - but they will make sure that you've got a good foundation to build on, and are ready to make the most out of the course. Importantly, this work will assure me that you

1. can self-direct progress on technical projects
2. have been exposed to the key technologies and workflows that we'll be using in class
3. can communicate difficulties and accomplishments clearly
4. have reflected on your learning style

Point 2 is not "have internalized every nuance", but I will expect you to at least be _familiar_ with e.g. `git` and the terminal - you're likely to feel lost out of the gate otherwise.

## Community and Help

One of the hardest skills for a junior dev to learn is how to ask for help. It is also one of the most important. I, of course, am here to help however I can. But you should also lean on the class and community around you.

Towards that end, you should sign up for [Slack](https://slack.com/) and join the [DC Tech Slack group](https://dctechslack.herokuapp.com/). As you run into trouble, ping me, talk to your classmates, and ask questions on the #ruby channel. As you run into resources that you find valuable, share them with your classmates in the [course wiki](https://github.com/TIY-DC-ROR-2015-May/course-notes/wiki).


## Requirements

Review and complete the tasks below by **May 11th**. Any deliverables should be emailed to me by then. If you have any questions, please email - I'll be glad to help (though expect some good-natured shaming if you're pushing the deadline).

You will need to sign up for Treehouse to complete some of these tasks. Treehouse is free for 14 days (which should be more than enough to finish the required work), and $25/month after the trial.


## Setup

### Install OSX Yosemite (if you haven’t already)

* You'll need to sign in to the Mac App Store with you Apple ID. If you don't have one, [sign up here](https://appleid.apple.com/).
* Download the Yosemite upgrade from the Apple Store: [download here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-yosemite/id915041082?mt=12).
* Double-click "Install OS X Yosemite” to begin installation.

WARNING: The OS X upgrade can take a bit of time to complete and will require a restart. Plan on doing this in the evening or over a lunch break.

### Install a text editor

As a developer, you spend most of your time reading, writing, and editing code, so it's no surprise that a text editor is one the most important tools to familiarize yourself with. I won't prescribe a particular editor, but would recommend one of the following:

* Sublime Text 3 - Pro: fully featured, very snappy, excellent package ecosystem. Con: non-free (nagware).
* Atom - Pro: similar to Sublime, free. Con: can be sluggish, especially to open.
* Ruby Mine - Pro: integrated Ruby-aware features (code completion, method lookups). Con: non-free, heavyweight.
* Vim - Pro: powerful modal editor, works in a terminal, ubiquitous. Con: steeeeep learning curve.

I use Vim myself, but won't be requiring it (learning Vim can distract too much from learning to code) - though you will likely see it and Sublime in lectures. Regardless of which editor you decide to use, spend some time familiarizing yourself with it (customizing and learning shortcuts, for instance). Mastering the tools you use every day will always pay dividends.


## The Command Line

The command line will be our primary interface to the computer, and aside from your editor, the place you will spend the most time. If you've never opened up a terminal before, now is the time to start getting comfortable.

* (Optional, but recommended) Install and use iTerm2 as your terminal
* Read http://skillcrush.com/2012/12/03/command-line-2/
* Go through the Treehouse course on [Getting Started with the Console](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations#getting-started-with-the-console)
* Go through the Treehouse course on [Users and Permissions](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations#users-and-permissions)
* Go through the Treehouse course on [Environment and Redirection](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/console-foundations#environment-and-redirection)
* Read and practice with [A Command Line Primer for Beginners](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything)


## Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Developers use such tools both to track their own work as it changes over time, and to collaborate with other developers on larger projects. I use Git on _every_ non-trivial project I work on, and this class will be no different.

Again, the objective is not to become an expert before the class, but just to start to get comfortable with the concepts and vocabulary. We'll continue to work with Git throughout the course and cover some of the more advanced concerns in class.

1. Go through the Treehouse course on [Git Basics](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/git-basics)
2. If you want to spend some more time with git, [Git immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) is a great resource.


## GitHub

GitHub is a website which hosts Git repositories. We will be hosting all of our class projects on GitHub, and it will likely be the center of your open-source world for some time to come. In many circles, your Github profile _is_ your resume, and it should be created with that in mind:

1. Sign up for a GitHub account at https://github.com/ - something professional, if not exactly your name
2. Make sure to add a profile picture and your full name
3. Email me the username you choose so that I can get you added to the group we'll be using for class
4. Check out the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) if you want to learn how to use GitHub prior to class.


## HTML / CSS

At the end of the day, our applications will be responsible for producing HTML and CSS. That said, we will be covering them rapidly, as many people are familiar with them from past experience. Especially if you are not, you should take some time to familiarize yourself with these foundational technologies.

1. Complete the [Codecademy HTML & CSS course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web)

(Treehouse has some additional material that you can check out, though it goes into more depth than I'd expect you to work through on your own.)

This class is primarily concerned with data flow and functionality over design, so a little bit of extra CSS experience can really help you stand out and make your projects look significantly more polished.


## Ruby

We'll cover Ruby from square one in class, but many of the concepts can take repeated exposure before sinking in. So, you don't really want your first exposure to be in lecture.

1. Complete the [Codecademy Ruby course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby); be sure you _understand_ at least through "Hashes and Symbols".


## Reflection

Good job! Take a step back and reflect on where you are. Did you enjoy any assignments in particular? Struggle with any? How are you feeling about the upcoming class? Excited? Nervous? How do you learn best? How can you maximize the value you get out of this course? Do you anticipate any problems? If so, how can we work to avoid them? Where do you want to be in 3 months? 12?

1. Write up your reflections and either send them to me via email.

We'll be encouraging this sort of reflections throughout the course - if you feel comfortable sharing publicly, this would be a good time to start a blog and post them there.


## Next Steps

If you've internalized the concepts from above, you should be ready for the first day. I'll be distributing a (hopefully) short assignment to help you gut-check whether you've really internalized the concepts.

Many of you are coming into class with some non-trivial Ruby experience, and I'll be asking correspondingly more out of you. If you've got some Ruby or general programming background already:

* I'll expect you to help out students who aren't as familiar with coding or Ruby. I promise - teaching will pay dividends for your learning. Please start now by adding notes about resources you've used and whether or not you found them helpful [to the class wiki](https://github.com/TIY-DC-ROR-2015-May/course-notes/wiki).
* I'll also expect you to be more self-directed in your learning, or at least vocal when you need more of a challenge. If you have extra bandwidth early on, I'd recommend looking into a language _other_ than Ruby (lest you just stay that much farther ahead). If you can divorce general concepts from language specifics, you'll understand your fundamentals that much better. Consider exploring Javascript, and aiming to understand it in the same depth as we cover Ruby; or a low-level language like C, to understand more about exactly how the computer executes; or an alien language like Haskell, to be exposed to important ideas from functional programming.

If you have no such experience, don't panic! We'll cover everything else that you really need. If you have extra time, I'd recommend getting as comfortable as possible with your system - using shortcuts, setting up your editor, using the terminal, manipulating files, &c. The sooner you feel at home there, the sooner you can focus on learning.

I'll say this many more times, but can't emphasize enough how much I mean it: I'm here to help. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Looking forward to day 0!
